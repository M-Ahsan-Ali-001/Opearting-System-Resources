# Forking a repository

<h2>Step-1</h2>
Click Fork

<h2>Step-2</h2>
Select an owner for the forked repository.
<h2>Step-3</h2>
By default, forks are named the same as their upstream repositories. You can change the name of the fork to distinguish it further.
<h2>Step-4</h2>
Choose whether to copy only the default branch or all branches to the new fork. For many forking scenarios, such as contributing to open-source projects, you only need to copy the default branch. By default, only the default branch is copied.
<h2>Step-5</h2>
Click Create fork.
