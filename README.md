# Forking a repository

<h2>Click Fork</h2>

<h2>Select an owner for the forked repository.</h2>


</h2>By default, forks are named the same as their upstream repositories. You can change the name of the fork to distinguish it further.<h2>

<h2>Choose whether to copy only the default branch or all branches to the new fork. For many forking scenarios, such as contributing to open-source projects, you only need to copy the default branch. By default, only the default branch is copied.</h2>

<h2>Click Create fork.
